Thank you for the purchase!

All of our work is thoroughly tested before it gets submitted to the Unity Asset 
Store, but sometimes bugs pop-up.  If you have any questions or concerns about 
this package, please contact us first before posting negative feedback on the 
Unity Asset Store.

We are happy to help with any issues you may encounter and we usually respond to
any e-mail we receive within a couple of hours.

If you like what you see, please don't forget to leave positive feedback on the Asset Store page!

Thank you!
